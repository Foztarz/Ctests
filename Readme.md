# Ctests
A set of wrapper scripts for performing circular hypothesis tests in ```R```
using the [```circular```](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/circular/index.html) and [```CircStats```](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CircStats/) packages.
Reads in ```.csv``` files in a specified format (see examples in the folder with test scripts) and outputs
